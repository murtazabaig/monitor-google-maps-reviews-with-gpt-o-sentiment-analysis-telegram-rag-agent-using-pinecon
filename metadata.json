  "description": "ANALYZE AND SYNC GOOGLE MAPS REVIEWS TO PINECONE> Note: This template requires an Apify account, an OpenAI account, and a> Pinecone database.OVERVIEWThis workflow automates your reputation management by scraping Google Mapsreviews, analyzing their sentiment using AI, and storing them in a VectorDatabase (Pinecone). It also includes a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)agent that allows you to chat with your review data via Telegram to ask specificquestions about customer feedback.HOW IT WORKS * Scrape: At a scheduled time (or manually), the workflow triggers an Apify actor to scrape the latest reviews from a specific Google Maps URL. * Analyze: It uses GPT-4o to analyze the sentiment of the reviews and generates a summary of complaints and praises. * Notify: A Telegram message is sent with the sentiment score and a summary of the latest reviews. * Store: The review data is embedded and upserted into a Pinecone Vector Store. * Chat (RAG): You can send messages to a Telegram bot to query the database (e.g., \"What are people saying about our coffee?\"). The AI retrieves relevant reviews from Pinecone to answer your question. * Cleanup: A weekly schedule cleans up the namespace to ensure data freshness (optional).HOW TO SET UP 1. Apify: Create an account and subscribe to the Google Maps Reviews Scraper actor. Set up your Apify credentials in n8n. 2. OpenAI: Set up your OpenAI credentials in n8n. 3. Pinecone: Create an Index in Pinecone. Set up your Pinecone credentials in n8n. 4. Telegram: Create a new bot via BotFather to get your Token and Chat ID.
